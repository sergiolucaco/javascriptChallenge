## Javascript Exercises 

### `randomLargest()`

Randomizes three numbers in range (0.. 100) and prints the largest one.

### `randomEven()`

Randomizes a number (range 0..100), then prints all the even numbers from 0 to the randomized.

### `randomOdd()`

Randomizes a number (range 0..100), then prints all the odd numbers from 40 to that one. If the number was smaller than 40 nothing should be printed

### `randomOddSmallers()`

Randomizes a number (range 0..100), then prints all the odd numbers from 40 to that one. If the number was smaller than 40, print all the numbers down to the randomized one (i.e. if the result was 37, you should print: 40, 39, 38, 37)

### `randomRandom()`

Randomizes a number n in range 0..100. Now randomizes n more numbers in that range, printing the largest of them.

### `randomSum()`

Randomizes a number (range 1000 .. 9999 ) and calculate the sum of its digits. For instance, if the randomized number was 1049, program should print 14

### `randomOne()`

Randomizes a number (range 1000..9999) and calculate the sum of its digits repeatedly until you reach one digit only. For instance, if the randomized number was 1049, program should print 5

### `randomSmallest()`(TODO)

Randomizes two numbers and prints the smallest number that is greater than one, such that both numbers are divided by it with no remainder. For instance, for 9 and 6 you should print 3. If there isn't one a proper note should be printed.

### `randomLeastCommon()`(TODO)

Randomizes two numbers and prints their least common multiplication of them. (use http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple for details)
Randomizes two numbers and prints their average and standard deviation.
